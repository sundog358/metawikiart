## Key Tips for Using Docusaurus Blog Plugin

### Adding Markdown Files

Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.

### Adding Authors

Regular blog authors can be added to `authors.yml`.

### Extracting Blog Post Date

The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:

- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`
- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`

### Co-locating Blog Post Images

A blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images.

### Using Tags

The blog supports tags as well!

## Conclusion

And if you don't want a blog: just delete this directory, and use `blog: false` in your Docusaurus config.

Happy blogging with Docusaurus!
