# Getting Started with Linked Open Data (LOD) and Docusaurus

Welcome to the **Meta Wiki Art** platform ! This guide will help you get started with Linked Open Data (LOD) concepts and set up a **Docusaurus** site to document your LOD projects.

## What is Linked Open Data (LOD)?

**Linked Open Data** refers to a way of structuring and linking datasets on the web, enabling them to be easily discovered, reused, and connected with other data sources. It uses standards such as **RDF** (Resource Description Framework), **SPARQL** (a query language for RDF), and **OWL** (Web Ontology Language) to represent and link data.

The key principles of Linked Open Data are:

1. **Use URIs** as names for things.
2. **Make URIs dereferenceable** to provide useful information when looked up.
3. **Use standards** like RDF and SPARQL for data representation.
4. **Link to other datasets** to enable users to discover more related data.

## What is Docusaurus?

**Docusaurus** is a modern, static website generator that makes it easy to build documentation websites. Itâ€™s particularly useful for creating structured and versioned documentation with built-in search and a developer-friendly interface.

Docusaurus provides:

- **Simple Setup**: Use Markdown or MDX for writing docs.
- **Versioning**: Manage multiple versions of your documentation.
- **Built-in Search**: Provides a search function to quickly find content.
- **Custom Pages**: Flexibility to build custom pages using React components.

## Why Use Docusaurus for Linked Open Data Documentation?

Docusaurus is an excellent tool for documenting Linked Open Data projects because it provides:

- **Structured navigation** for complex datasets.
- **Versioning** for managing updates to your datasets and documentation.
- **Easy deployment** to static site hosting platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

By combining Docusaurus with Linked Open Data, you can create well-organized, searchable documentation that helps users navigate your data easily.

## Setting Up Your Docusaurus Site for Linked Open Data

### Step 1: Prerequisites

Before setting up your Docusaurus site, you will need:

- **Node.js** installed on your machine.
- **Yarn** or **npm** as your package manager.

### Step 2: Initialize a Docusaurus Project

To get started, you can use the Docusaurus CLI to create a new project:

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic
cd my-website
yarn start
```
